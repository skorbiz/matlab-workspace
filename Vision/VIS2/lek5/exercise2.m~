%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% YOUR RANSAC CODE GOES HERE %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Recommendation: use the spin image descriptors to find correspondences
% between object/scene points. Three point pairs are enough for estimating
% a transformation in each RANSAC  iteration. Then you can evaluate a fit
% error or count the number of inliers to check the sampled transformation.
%
% Functions that you may want to use:
%   spin_images - Find spin image descriptors for a point set
%   randperm - Find random unique indices using sampling without
%              replacement
%   knnsearch - Find nearest neighbor(s) between sets of vectors, both 3D
%               points and descriptors
%   transformation_estimation_svd - Estimate transformation between two 3D
%                                   point sets
%   transform_points - Apply a transformation to a set of points
%
% NOTE: when you are done, remember to apply the resulting transformation
% to object_align for the alignment visualization below to work.
